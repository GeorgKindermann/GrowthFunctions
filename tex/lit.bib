Growth/temperature relationships were studied using two mathematical equations: the Arrhenius relationship (k = Ae-μ/RT) and the Square Root relationship (√r = b(T − To)). The Square Root equation was found to be the better description of the microbial growth/temperature relationship at chill temperatures and was also applicable to mixtures of organisms. Implications of these results in relation to food analysis are discussed. },

Iterative multiple linear regression analysis is used to obtain least squares estimates of the constants defining theoretical nutrient-response curves. Curves thus generated accurately predict experimentally observed responses. From this treatment, response parameters are developed which are analogous to Vmax and Km of enzyme kinetics. It is proposed that this model be applied in evaluating nutritional requirements and in assessing the relative biological efficiency of nutrient sources.},

Furthermore, new parameters for the simplest two-asymptote, third-degree form of the well-known Pearl-Reed function can be specified so as to locate a point of inflection free from the effects of two additional parameters specifying the manner in which the function approaches its asymptotes. Convenient expressions for derivatives and partial derivatives of all the new functions and the locations of points of inflection in terms of the new parameters are given to help interested scientists in preparing short FORTRAN or ALGOL subroutines for use with existing computer programs, and in making close initial estimates of parameters so that convergence of iterative solutions will be more likely.},

The model is intended to represent a warm-blooded vertebrate predator and its prey. The main conclusions are: (1) Coexistence of predator and prey is possible, but if so, the number of prey present will not be substantially below the equilibrium number in the absence of predators. Mutual regulation of predator and prey, with the latter substantially below the carrying capacity of the environment, is unstable. (2) Coexistence is more likely if there are differences in hunting ability between different individual predators--for example, between young and old predators. (3) Cover for the prey enables the prey species to survive the extinction of the predator, but does not make coexistence more likely.},

  Abstract                 = {Growth of plants results from two opposing factors: the intrinsic tendency toward unlimited increase (biotic potential) and restraints imposed by environmental resistance and aging. The expansion tendency prevails in the beginning of a tree's life, while growth decline becomes prominent toward the end. The existing growth equations can be transformed (by differentiation, decomposition into the division components, and taking logarithms) so that the components that correspond to these two factors are exposed. This transformation reveals two basic forms intrinsic in most of the analyzed equations. Their common feature is that growth expansion is proportional to current tree size. Growth decline of individual trees appears to be more variable and can be rendered with equal accuracy by a variety of expressions. This may reflect that a greater number of factors hinder growth: scarcity of resources, competition, reproduction, diseases, herbivory, disturbances, etc. Consequently, the growth path is inherently imprecise and can be viewed as a wide valley rather than a single line. This analysis laid groundwork for the classification of known equations and made possible the discovery of a promising new equation form. For. Sci. 39(3):594-616.},

The first asserts that the rate of growth is jointly proportional to a monotonic function of the generalized distance from the origin to present size (“reproductive capability”), and to a monotonic function of the generalized distance from present size to ultimate size (“limiting factor”). The second postulate restricts the monotonic function to power (or “mass action”) functions. The third postulate constrains the model to a mathematically tractable set which never-the-less is sufficiently general to include the cases of Malthusian, Gompertz, logistic and Bertalanffy-Richards Growth. The most general case is termed the “generic growth model”. Other special cases are termed hyperGompertzian and hyperlogistic growth. Generic growth is illustrated by rat weight data from the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {The absorption of radiation from the sun in an atmosphere varying exponentially with the height is considered, as in a former paper; but here the earth's curvature, and that of the level layers in the atmosphere, is taken into account. The values of this absorption as previously calculated are valid so long as the sun's zenith distance does not exceed 75°, but for greater zenith distances the necessary corrections are of importance. It is shown that the absorption, and resulting ionization or dissociation of the air, should begin to increase before ground sunrise, the interval varying from about 10 minutes at the equator to about an hour at 60° latitude.},

  Abstract                 = {Improvements in assay technology have reduced the amount of random variation in measured responses to the point where even slight asymmetry of the assay data can be more significant than random variation. Use of the five-parameter logistic (5PL) function to fit dose–response data easily accommodates such asymmetry. The 5PL can dramatically improve the accuracy of asymmetric assays over the use of symmetric models such as the four-parameter logistic (4PL) function. Until recently, however, the process of fitting the 5PL function has been difficult, with the result that the 4PL function has continued to be used even for highly asymmetric data. Various ad hoc modifications of the 4PL method have been developed in an attempt to address asymmetric data. However, recent advances in numerical methods and assay analysis software have rendered easier the fitting of the 5PL routine. This paper demonstrates how use of the 5PL function can improve assay performance over the 4PL and its variants. Specifically, the improvement in the accuracy of concentration estimates that can be obtained using the 5PL over the 4PL as a function of the asymmetry present in the data is studied. The behavior of the 5PL curve and how it differs from the 4PL curve are discussed. Common experimental designs, which can lead to ill-conditioned regression problems, are also examined. },
